# **Welcome to the Drone Intrusion Repository!**
A Python-based geospatial and statistical framework for analyzing Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) intrusions near U.S. airspace. This repository supports interactive 3D visualizations, Bayesian risk models, and reproducible geospatial preprocessing workflows.

You should be concerned with the following files:
-  `requirements.txt` for the imports, installs needed
-  `documentation_of_code_workflow.ipynb` for everything you need to run the analysis
**IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE OPEN the python notebook using this [link](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/vishalival/drone-intrusion&urlpath=tree/drone-intrusion/documentation_of_code_workflow.ipynb) and not directly in Github. Thank you!**

This repo includes:
- ALL raw data for the thesis
- Raw data loading and pre-processing from FA
- Edge case and null-handling strategies
- Geospatial KMZ extraction logic
- Model diagnostics and posterior predictive checks
